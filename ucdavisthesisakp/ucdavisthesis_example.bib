abstract = {A novel method is presented for model uncertainty estimation using machine learning techniques and its application in rainfall runoff modeling. In this method, first, the probability distribution of the model error is estimated separately for different hydrological situations and second, the parameters characterizing this distribution are aggregated and used as output target values for building the training sets for the machine learning model. This latter model, being trained, encapsulates the information about the model error localized for different hydrological conditions in the past and is used to estimate the probability distribution of the model error for the new hydrological model runs. The M5 model tree is used as a machine learning model. The method is tested to estimate uncertainty of a conceptual rainfall runoff model of the Bagmati catchment in Nepal. In this paper the method is extended further to enable it to predict an approximation of the whole error distribution, and also the new results of comparing this method to other uncertainty estimation approaches are reported. It can be concluded that the method generates consistent, interpretable and improved model uncertainty estimates.}

title = "Towards the characterization of streamflow simulation uncertainty through multimodel ensembles",
abstract = "Distributed hydrologic modeling holds significant promise for improved estimates of streamflow with high spatial resolution. However, uncertainty in model structure and parameters, which are distributed in space, and in operational weather radar rainfall estimates, which comprise the main input to the models, contributes to significant uncertainty in distributed model streamflow simulations over a wide range of space and time scales. Using the simulations produced for the Distributed Model Intercomparison Project (DMIP), this paper develops and applies sample-path methods to characterize streamflow simulation uncertainty by diverse distributed hydrologic models. The emphasis in this paper is on the model parameter and structure uncertainty given radar rainfall forcing. Multimodel ensembles are analyzed for six application catchments in the Central US to characterize model structure uncertainty within the sample of models (both calibrated and uncalibrated) participating in DMIP. Ensembles from single distributed and lumped models are also used for one of the catchments to provide a basis to characterize the impact of parametric uncertainty versus model structure uncertainty in flow simulation statistics. Two main science questions are addressed: (a) what is the value of multimodel streamflow ensembles in terms of the probabilistic characterization of simulation uncertainty? And (b) how do probabilistic skill measures of multimodel versus single-model ensembles compare? Discussed also are implications for the operational use of streamflow ensembles generated by distributed hydrologic models. The results support the serious consideration of ensemble simulations and predictions created by diverse models in real time flow prediction.",

abstract = "Scientists increasingly use ensemble data sets to explore relationships present in dynamic systems. Ensemble data sets combine spatio-temporal simulation results generated using multiple numerical models, sampled input conditions and perturbed parameters. While ensemble data sets are a powerful tool for mitigating uncertainty, they pose significant visualization and analysis challenges due to their complexity. In this article, we present Ensemble-Vis, a framework consisting of a collection of overview and statistical displays linked through a high level of interactivity. Ensemble-Vis allows scientists to gain key scientific insight into the distribution of simulation results as well as the uncertainty associated with the scientific data. In contrast to methods that present large amounts of diverse information in a single display, we argue that combining multiple linked displays yields a clearer presentation of the data and facilitates a greater level of visual data analysis. We demonstrate our framework using driving problems from climate modeling and meteorology and discuss generalizations to other fields.",

doi = {10.1093/mnras/262.3.627}, 
abstract ={We present an analytical description of the merging of virialized haloes which is applicable to any hierarchical model in which structure grows via gravitational instability. The formulae are an extension of the Press-Schechter model. The dependence of the merger rate on halo mass, epoch, the spectrum of initial density fluctuations and the density parameter ?0 is explicitly quantified. We calculate the distribution of halo formation times and survival times. We also describe a Monte Carlo method for constructing representative histories of merger events leading to formation of haloes of a prescribed mass.Applying these results to the age distribution of rich clusters of galaxies, we infer that a high value of the density parameter (?0 ? 0.5) is required to reproduce the substantial fraction of rich clusters that exhibit significant substructure, if such substructure only persists for a time 0.2t0 after a merger, where t0 is the present age of the universe. We also investigate the rate of infall of satellite galaxies into galactic discs, by combining our Monte Carlo technique for halo mergers with an estimate of the time required for dynamical friction to erode the orbits of the baryonic cores of the accreted galaxies. We find that, even for ?0 = 1, the infall rate is low (provided that the satellite orbits are not too eccentric), and that we would expect only a modest fraction of stellar discs to be thickened or disrupted by this process.},
